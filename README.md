## About

Nexus is a full-stack, multi-tenant project management platform built for teams that need more than a basic Kanban board.

- **5 board views** — Kanban, Calendar, Gantt, Table, Workload
- **Dual-gate RBAC** — Organization-level + board-level access control with 28 granular permissions
- **Real-time collaboration** — Live board updates, cursor presence, card edit locking via Supabase WebSockets
- **AI-powered workflows** — Checklist generation, card suggestions, and content summaries via OpenAI
- **Stripe billing** — FREE and PRO plans with full webhook lifecycle management
- **Public REST API** — API key authentication with per-scope permissions
- **GDPR compliant** — Data export and deletion endpoints built in
- **Production-ready security** — SSRF protection, audit logs, rate limiting, Row-Level Security

> Built as a self-hostable alternative to Trello and Jira — with multi-organization support, a public API, and enterprise-grade security architecture out of the box.

**Code quality status:**
- TypeScript: **0 errors** across all 99 components, 40 server actions, and 34 lib modules
- ESLint: **0 warnings** — all Tailwind v4 utilities, a11y rules, and import rules pass cleanly
- Hydration: **0 mismatches** — all CSS utilities use bracket syntax (`gap-[5px]`, `h-[30px]`) for consistency between server and client renders

**What makes the architecture distinct:**
- `orgId` is **always** extracted from the Clerk JWT — never accepted from client parameters
- Even organization owners need an explicit `BoardMember` row to access a board (dual-gate model)
- Supabase is used **exclusively** for WebSocket events — all DB reads/writes go through Prisma
- RLS enforces tenant boundaries at the database level, even if application checks are bypassed

## Screenshots

> All screenshots are located in the `Web-screenshort/` folder.  
> The application fully supports **dark mode** (default) and **light mode** with an instant toggle.

### Landing Page

![Landing Page](Web-screenshort/Landing%20Page.png)

- Dark-theme marketing landing page at `/` — the first thing visitors see
- **Canvas nebula background** — animated starfield with drifting orbs and constellation lines, rendered on a full-viewport `<canvas>` element at 60 fps
- **Custom cursor** — pink-to-blue gradient dot with a trailing ring that follows via lerp animation; scales up with glow on hover over interactive elements; auto-hidden on touch devices
- **Hero section** — "Your team's work, beautifully connected" headline with live badge ("Supabase Realtime · Now Live"), stats bar (10K+ teams, 99.9% SLA, <50ms sync), and primary CTA
- **3D parallax board showcase** — three floating mock browser windows (Kanban, Dashboard, Analytics) that tilt on mouse movement via `rotateX`/`rotateY` transforms
- **Bento feature grid** — 7 cards covering: Real-time Collaboration, LexoRank Ordering, Analytics, Dual-gate RBAC, Audit Logs, Stripe Billing, and Command Palette (⌘K) — each with animated mini-demos
- **Draggable screenshot carousel** — horizontal scroll track with mock screenshots of Dashboard, Kanban Board, Analytics, Activity Feed, and Billing views; drag to scroll with grab/grabbing cursor
- **Workflow steps** — 4-step guide: Create Workspace → Build Boards → Collaborate Live → Track Progress
- **Tech stack ticker** — infinite-scrolling marquee of the 10 core technologies (Next.js 16, TypeScript, Supabase, Prisma, Clerk, Stripe, Tailwind, shadcn/ui, Vercel Edge, LexoRank)
- **CTA section** — gradient call-to-action ("Ship faster. Build together.") with sign-up and sign-in buttons
- **Footer** — branding, copyright, and quick links (Privacy, Terms, GitHub, Get Started)
- **Performance** — scroll reveal via `IntersectionObserver`, `will-change` hints on animated elements, `prefers-reduced-motion` support for accessibility
- Server Component wrapper at `page.tsx` — checks auth server-side and redirects signed-in users to `/dashboard`; all interactive content lives in a `"use client"` component

### Architecture Decision Records

**Next.js App Router over Pages Router**
- React Server Components render data-heavy pages with zero client-side JS
- Server Actions co-locate mutations with UI — type-safe, Zod-validated, no custom API routes needed
- Built-in `cache()` deduplicates DB calls within a single request

**Supabase + Prisma together (not one or the other)**
- Prisma handles 100% of all read/write queries with full TypeScript type safety
- Supabase is used exclusively for its Realtime engine — `postgres_changes`, `presence`, `broadcast`
- The database connection goes through Prisma via PgBouncer (port 6543)
- The Supabase client never writes to the database directly

**Clerk over NextAuth**
- Built-in multi-organization support with org-scoped JWTs
- The `orgId` JWT claim is the foundation of the entire tenant isolation model
- Webhook-driven user provisioning with auto-healing on first sign-in

**LexoRank over integer or fractional ordering**
- String-based ordering: O(1) insertions, only one DB row updated per move
- No floating-point degradation after many insertions (unlike fractional indexing)
- Built-in rebalancing when strings grow too long

**Server vs Client Component split**
- Server: data fetching, layout shells, board pages, settings pages
- Client: drag-and-drop, real-time subscriptions, modals, command palette, presence
- React Compiler (`babel-plugin-react-compiler`) provides automatic memoization — no manual `useMemo`/`useCallback` needed

---

## Multi-Tenant System & RBAC

### How Tenant Isolation Works

Every request follows this exact path:

1. `auth()` from `@clerk/nextjs/server` reads the session cookie and extracts signed JWT claims: `userId`, `orgId`, `orgRole`
2. `orgId` is **never** accepted from query parameters, request bodies, or URL paths — this is enforced in `lib/tenant-context.ts`
3. `getTenantContext()` resolves the internal `User` UUID from the Clerk user ID
4. If the user row doesn't exist (first sign-in), it creates one automatically — the "healing" path
5. The function loads the `OrganizationUser` membership record. If missing but the Clerk org exists, it auto-creates the membership
6. Users with `isActive=false` or `status=SUSPENDED` are rejected immediately with a `TenantError`
7. The entire function is wrapped in React's `cache()` — one DB call maximum per request

                    28 Granular Permissions Checked Per Action
```

### Role Hierarchy

**Organization Level**

| Role | Capabilities |
|---|---|
| OWNER | Full org control, billing, member management, all boards |
| ADMIN | Member management, create boards, org settings |
| MEMBER | Participate in boards they're added to |
| GUEST | Limited access, read-only by default |

**Board Level**

| Role | Capabilities |
|---|---|
| OWNER | All board operations, delete board, manage members |
| ADMIN | Edit settings, manage members, configure permissions |
| MEMBER | Create/edit/move cards, comment, upload files, track time |
| VIEWER | Read-only access to board and cards |

### Permission Schemes

- Each board can have a custom `PermissionScheme` that overrides the default role-to-permission matrix
- Individual `BoardMember` records can also have their own `PermissionScheme` for member-level customization
- 28 granular permissions cover every action: `CREATE_CARD`, `DELETE_CARD`, `MOVE_CARD`, `MANAGE_MEMBERS`, `CHANGE_PERMISSIONS`, and more

### Realtime Channel Isolation

- Every Supabase channel name includes `orgId`: `org:{orgId}:board:{boardId}`
- `lib/realtime-channels.ts` validates that `orgId` does not contain the `:` delimiter before constructing channel names
- This prevents injection attacks and ensures WebSocket events never leak across tenants

### Database-Level RLS

- The Prisma client sets `app.current_org_id` as a PostgreSQL session variable on every connection
- Row-Level Security policies filter all queries by this variable at the database engine level
- Even if application-level RBAC checks are bypassed, data from other organizations cannot be read
- A separate `systemDb` Prisma client bypasses RLS for trusted system operations (Stripe webhooks, cron jobs)

```

### Route Protection Strategy

There is no `middleware.ts` file. Auth is enforced at the action/route level:

- **Security headers** applied via `next.config.ts` for all routes
- **Server Actions** call `getTenantContext()` as the first operation
- **API routes** call `authenticateApiKey()` for public v1 endpoints, or `getTenantContext()` for internal endpoints

**Public routes (no auth):**
- `/sign-in`, `/sign-up` — Clerk managed
- `/shared/[token]` — Guest board access via share token
- `/privacy`, `/terms` — Legal pages
- `/api/health` — Health check
- `/api/webhook/stripe` — HMAC-verified Stripe webhooks

## Database Architecture

### What the Database Is

Nexus uses **PostgreSQL** hosted on **Supabase**. All database access goes through **Prisma ORM** — a type-safe query builder that auto-generates TypeScript types from the schema. The database is never accessed directly from the browser.

### Schema Overview

- **35 models** — every concept in the app (boards, cards, users, labels, sprints, etc.) has its own table
- **13 enums** — fixed value sets used across the schema: `BoardRole`, `OrgRole`, `Priority`, `ACTION`, `ENTITY_TYPE`, `SubscriptionPlan`, and more
- **All primary keys are CUID strings** — e.g. `clx1a2b3c4d5e6f7g8h` — not auto-incremented integers
  - CUIDs are collision-resistant, URL-safe, and do not expose creation order to attackers
- **Two database connections are configured:**
  - `DATABASE_URL` → PgBouncer pooler on port **6543** — used by the app for all reads and writes; handles high concurrency efficiently
  - `DIRECT_URL` → direct PostgreSQL on port **5432** — used only by Prisma Migrate when running schema migrations
- **Row-Level Security (RLS)** is enabled — the app sets a PostgreSQL session variable `app.current_org_id` on every connection; RLS policies filter all rows by this variable at the database engine level, so even a misconfigured app query cannot read another tenant's data
- **A separate `systemDb` Prisma client bypasses RLS** — used only for trusted internal operations: Stripe webhooks, cron jobs, and admin seeding
- **Cascade deletes are configured carefully:**
  - Deleting a Board cascades to: Lists → Cards → Comments → Attachments → Checklists → ChecklistItems → BoardMembers → Sprints → Epics → SavedViews → MembershipRequests
  - Deleting an Organization does **not** cascade automatically — this is an intentional safety guard to prevent accidental data loss
- **JSON columns** are used where flexibility is needed — automation triggers/conditions/actions, webhook payloads, and audit log before/after snapshots are all stored as JSON
- **Denormalized user fields** — `Comment` and `AuditLog` store `userName` and `userImage` directly in the row so historical records remain accurate even if a user changes their name or profile picture later

### Core Entity Relationship Diagram

> **How to read this diagram:**
> - `||--o{` means "one-to-many" — for example one Organization contains many Boards
> - `||--||` means "one-to-one" — for example one User has exactly one UserPreference
> - `}o--o|` means "many-to-optional-one" — for example many Boards can optionally use one PermissionScheme

**Plain English walkthrough of every relationship:**

- **Organization → Board** — Every board belongs to exactly one organization. An organization can have many boards (up to 50 on FREE plan, unlimited on PRO).
- **Organization → OrganizationUser** — This is the membership table. It records which users are members of which organization, and their role (OWNER / ADMIN / MEMBER / GUEST).
- **Organization → Label** — Labels (coloured tags applied to cards) are defined at the organization level and shared across all boards in that org.
- **Organization → Automation** — Automation rules ("when X happens, do Y") are set up per organization.
- **Organization → Webhook** — Outbound HTTP webhooks are registered per organization. When events happen, Nexus sends signed HTTP POST requests to the configured URLs.
- **Organization → ApiKey** — API keys for the public REST API are issued per organization.
- **Organization → PermissionScheme** — Custom permission schemes can be created per organization and then applied to individual boards or members.
- **Organization → MembershipRequest** — When someone requests to join the organization, a record is created here.
- **Organization → Initiative** — High-level strategic initiatives that group multiple epics together.
- **Organization → Notification** — In-app notifications sent to org members.
- **User → OrganizationUser** — A user can be a member of multiple organizations (through multiple OrganizationUser rows).
- **User → BoardMember** — A user can be a member of multiple boards.
- **User → Card** — Cards can be assigned to a user (the assignee).
- **User → TimeLog** — Users log their time spent working on cards.
- **User → ApiKey** — Each API key is owned by a specific user.
- **User → UserPreference** — One-to-one settings record per user: theme preference, notification settings, etc.
- **Board → List** — A board contains multiple lists (Kanban columns like "To Do", "In Progress", "Done").
- **Board → BoardMember** — Tracks which users have access to a specific board and their role on that board.
- **Board → Sprint** — Boards can have sprints for Scrum-style time-boxed work.
- **Board → BoardShare** — Public share links for guest access are stored here with expiry and password.
- **Board → Epic** — Large features or themes that group related cards together.
- **Board → SavedView** — Users can save filter combinations (e.g. "My high priority cards") as named views.
- **Board → MembershipRequest** — Users can request access to a specific board.
- **Board ↔ PermissionScheme** — A board can optionally be linked to a custom permission scheme that overrides the default role matrix.
- **List → Card** — Each list contains multiple cards. Cards are ordered by their `order` field (LexoRank string).
- **Card → Comment** — Cards have threaded comments. Each comment is a rich-text entry made by a user.
- **Card → Attachment** — Files uploaded to a card are stored in Supabase Storage; the Attachment record holds the URL, filename, size, and uploader.
- **Card → Checklist** — A card can have multiple named checklists, each containing multiple checkbox items.
- **Card → CardLabelAssignment** — Labels are applied to cards through this join table (many-to-many between Card and Label).
- **Card → TimeLog** — Individual time log entries per card per user.
- **Card → CardDependency** — Links between cards: "this card blocks that card", "this card is blocked by that card", or "related".
- **Card ↔ Sprint** — A card can optionally be placed inside a sprint.
- **Card ↔ Epic** — A card can optionally belong to an epic.
- **Label → CardLabelAssignment** — Each label can be applied to many cards.
- **Checklist → ChecklistItem** — Each checklist has multiple items; each item has a `completed` boolean.
- **Comment → CommentReaction** — Emoji reactions on comments (like Slack reactions).
- **Comment → Comment** — Comments can have replies (self-referential relationship).
- **PermissionScheme → PermissionSchemeEntry** — Each scheme has multiple entries, each mapping a role to a specific permission.
- **Automation → AutomationLog** — Every time an automation rule runs, a log entry is created with the result.
- **Webhook → WebhookDelivery** — Every outbound webhook request is logged with the HTTP status, response body, and timing.
- **Initiative → Epic** — An initiative groups multiple epics (cross-board strategic planning).

| `eventType` | String | The Stripe event type (e.g. `checkout.session.completed`) |
| `processedAt` | DateTime | When the event was first processed |

When a Stripe event arrives, the handler attempts to `INSERT` a row before the `switch` statement. If a row already exists (duplicate delivery → Prisma `P2002` error), the handler returns HTTP 200 immediately without re-running business logic. This is an additional safety layer on top of the 300-second staleness check — it handles retries delivered within the staleness window.

---

### Database Design Decisions

- **CUID primary keys** — CUIDs look like `clx1a2b3c4d` — they are random enough to be unguessable, safe to expose in URLs, and work in distributed environments without a central sequence counter
- **LexoRank `order` field** — Cards and lists are sorted by a string like `"m"` or `"nt"` instead of integers. Moving a card only requires updating that one card's `order` string — no other rows are touched regardless of how many items are in the list
- **Denormalized user fields on Comment + AuditLog** — Storing `userName` and `userImage` directly in those rows means historical records stay accurate even after a user renames themselves or changes avatar. No join required either, which speeds up the activity feed.
- **JSON columns** — `Automation.trigger/conditions/actions`, `WebhookDelivery.payload`, and `AuditLog.previousValues/newValues` use JSON because their shape varies by use case — using JSON avoids dozens of extra tables for each automation trigger type or action type
- **Cascade deletes (Board → List → Card → …)** — Deleting a board automatically cleans up all child records so no orphaned data is left behind. The cascade chain is: Board → Lists → Cards → (Comments, Attachments, Checklists, Labels, TimeLogs, Dependencies, BoardMembers, Sprints, Epics, SavedViews)
- **Organization deletion is NOT cascaded** — Deleting an org is a rare, irreversible action. Nexus requires explicit cleanup to prevent accidental mass data loss from a single API call
- **Separate `systemDb` for trusted operations** — Stripe webhooks and cron jobs use a Prisma client that bypasses Row-Level Security. This is intentional — these processes need to read/write across tenant boundaries, but they authenticate via HMAC signatures and cron secrets rather than Clerk JWTs

---

## Drag & Drop System

### LexoRank Ordering — How It Works

LexoRank is a string-based ordering system. Implementation lives in `lib/lexorank.ts`.

- Items are ordered lexicographically: `"m"` < `"n"` < `"o"`
- **`generateNextOrder(lastOrder)`** — appends the next character: `"m"` → `"n"` → ... → `"z"` → `"za"` → `"zb"`
- **`generateMidpointOrder(before, after)`** — calculates a midpoint string for mid-list insertions
- **`rebalanceOrders(items)`** — resets all items to clean values when strings grow too long

**Why not integer ordering?**
Moving a card to position 3 in a 100-item list requires updating all items at positions 3–100. LexoRank only updates the moved card.

**Why not fractional indexing?**
After ~50 moves between the same two positions, floating-point precision degrades and causes ordering bugs. LexoRank strings can always generate a valid midpoint.

### Drag & Drop End-to-End Flow

```
1. User starts dragging a card (via @dnd-kit DragOverlay)
        │
2. Optimistic UI update fires immediately
   └── use-optimistic-card hook updates local state before server responds
        │
3. User drops card in new position
        │
4. LexoRank calculates new order string based on neighbors
        │
5. Server Action fires: update-card-order
   └── Validates input (Zod)
   └── getTenantContext() checks auth + permissions
   └── Prisma updates Card.order in DB (one row)
        │
6. emitCardEvent() fires
   └── Automation engine evaluates matching rules
   └── Webhooks fire (HMAC-signed)
        │
7. Supabase postgres_changes broadcasts update to all connected clients
        │
8. Other users see the card move in real time via use-realtime-board hook
```

---

## Real-Time System

### Architecture

Supabase is used **exclusively** for its Realtime WebSocket engine. All database reads and writes go through Prisma only.

### Channel Map

| Channel Pattern | Purpose | Hook |
|---|---|---|
| `org:{orgId}:board:{boardId}` | Card/list CRUD events | `use-realtime-board` |
| `org:{orgId}:presence:{boardId}` | Online user tracking | `use-presence` |
| `org:{orgId}:analytics:{boardId}` | Live metrics broadcast | `use-realtime-analytics` |
| `org:{orgId}:boards` | Org-wide board list updates | — |
| `org:{orgId}:activity` | Audit log feed | — |

### Card Edit Locking Flow

```
User A opens card for editing
        │
        ├── Broadcasts presence on board channel with cardId
        │
User B views same card
        │
        ├── Receives presence event: "Card locked by User A"
        ├── Edit button disabled
        │
User A closes card
        │
        ├── Presence removed (or disconnects)
        ├── Lock released
        │
User B can now edit
```

A `cancelled` flag in the async setup prevents race conditions during rapid open/close cycles.

### Optimistic Updates

```
User performs action (e.g., adds label)
        │
        ├── useOptimistic updates UI immediately (0ms delay)
        │
Server Action runs in background
        │
        ├── Success → Supabase broadcast confirms the change
        │
        └── Failure → UI rolls back to previous state
```

## Server Actions

All server actions follow the `createSafeAction` pattern from `lib/create-safe-action.ts`:
1. Input validated by Zod schema
2. `getTenantContext()` resolves auth and tenant
3. Permission check against RBAC matrix
4. Database mutation (Prisma, scoped to `orgId`)
5. `emitCardEvent()` triggers automations and webhooks
6. `createAuditLog()` records the action

**40 server actions across these domains:**

| Domain | Action Files |
|---|---|
| Board | `create-board.ts`, `update-board.ts`, `delete-board.ts` |
| Card | `create-card.ts`, `update-card.ts`, `delete-card.ts`, `update-card-order.ts` |
| List | `create-list.ts`, `update-list.ts`, `delete-list.ts`, `update-list-order.ts` |
| Members | `board-member-actions.ts` |
| Permissions | `permission-scheme-actions.ts` |
| Membership | `membership-request-actions.ts` |
| Sharing | `board-share-actions.ts` |
| Automations | `automation-actions.ts` |
| AI | `ai-actions.ts` |
| Sprints | `sprint-actions.ts` |
| Roadmap | `roadmap-actions.ts` |
| Time Tracking | `time-tracking-actions.ts` |

**E2E (Playwright)**
- `boards.spec.ts` — Board creation, navigation, management
- `cards.spec.ts` — Card CRUD and interactions
- `tenant-isolation.spec.ts` — Multi-tenant data isolation (two users, two orgs)
- `user-journeys.spec.ts` — Full end-to-end user workflows

### Running Tests

```bash
# All tests in watch mode
npm test

# All tests with coverage report
npm run test:ci

# Unit tests only
npm run test:unit

# Integration tests only
npm run test:integration

# Single file
npx jest --testPathPattern=tenant-context

## Security

### Tenant Isolation

- `orgId` is **never** accepted from client input — always from the signed Clerk JWT
- **Row-Level Security (RLS)** — Prisma sets `app.current_org_id` as a PostgreSQL session variable. RLS policies filter at the DB engine level
- **Dual-gate RBAC** — Organization membership and board membership verified independently. No implicit access even for org admins
- **Realtime channel isolation** — All channels include `orgId`. Names are validated before subscription to prevent injection

### Rate Limiting

**Action-level limiting** — `lib/action-protection.ts`:

- Sliding-window limiter using in-memory `Map<string, number[]>` with 60-second windows
- Per-action limits:
  - Card creation: 60 requests/minute
  - Card reorder: 120 requests/minute
  - Default: 30 requests/minute
- Returns `{ allowed, remaining, retryAfter }` for client-side handling

**Route-level limiting** — `lib/rate-limit.ts`:

- **Distributed (Upstash Redis)** when `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL` + `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN` are set — sliding-window via `@upstash/ratelimit`; state shared across all Vercel instances
- **In-memory fallback** — GC-enabled `Map<string, number[]>` with GC every 200 calls; used when Upstash is not configured or if Redis is temporarily unavailable (fail-open to keep the app live)
- Applied to `/api/ai`: 20 requests per user per minute; returns 429 + `Retry-After` header on breach
- Ratelimit instances are cached in-process per `limit:windowMs` key — no Redis round-trip overhead for setup

### Webhook Security

- **Inbound (Stripe)** — HMAC signature verification via `stripe-signature` header before any processing
- **Outbound (user webhooks)** — HMAC-SHA256 signing with per-webhook secrets, delivered as `X-Nexus-Signature-256`
- **SSRF protection** — Outbound webhooks block:
  - Private IPv4 ranges: `10.0.0.0/8`, `172.16.0.0/12`, `192.168.0.0/16`, `127.0.0.0/8`
  - IPv6 private/loopback/link-local ranges
  - Cloud metadata endpoints: `metadata.google.internal`, `169.254.169.254`

### Audit Logging

Every mutation captured via `createAuditLog()`:

- **Who** — userId, userName, userImage
- **What** — action enum, entityType, entityId, entityTitle
- **When** — createdAt timestamp
- **Where** — ipAddress, userAgent (from request headers)
- **Before/after** — previousValues and newValues as JSON snapshots

Failures captured in Sentry — never silently swallowed.

### Security Headers

Configured in `next.config.ts` for all routes:

```
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
X-Frame-Options: DENY
Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
Permissions-Policy: camera=(), microphone=(), geolocation=(), interest-cohort=()
X-Permitted-Cross-Domain-Policies: none
Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin
Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy: same-origin
```

Production-only (HTTPS required):

```
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=63072000; includeSubDomains; preload
```

### Input Validation

- All Server Actions validate input via Zod schemas before any processing
- Prisma uses parameterized queries throughout — SQL injection is not possible
- `TenantError` messages are mapped to generic client-safe strings — internal IDs and stack traces never reach the client

### RBAC Atomicity

The auto-heal path in `lib/tenant-context.ts` runs inside `db.$transaction()`. When a missing `OrganizationUser` row is created, the operation:
1. Re-checks for an existing row **inside the transaction** to defeat concurrent duplicate inserts
2. Uses the actual DB `isActive` and `status` values from the healed row — never trusts JWT defaults
3. Throws `TenantError FORBIDDEN` immediately if the healed row has `isActive = false` or `status = SUSPENDED`

This prevents a race condition where two parallel requests could both pass the membership check before either write committed.

### Realtime Channel Authentication

`hooks/use-realtime-analytics.ts` now uses `getAuthenticatedSupabaseClient(token)` with a Clerk JWT fetched via `getToken({ template: "supabase" })`. This matches the security posture already in place for `use-realtime-board.ts` and `use-presence.ts`. If the Clerk JWT template is not configured, the hook falls back gracefully to the anonymous key.

### LexoRank DoS Guard

`actions/update-card-order.ts` and `actions/update-list-order.ts` reject any order string exceeding 64 characters with a safe error message. Normal LexoRank strings max out at ~32 characters; this cap only triggers on malformed or malicious payloads.

### Stripe Idempotency

`app/api/webhook/stripe/route.ts` records every processed Stripe event in the `ProcessedStripeEvent` table (Prisma model added 2026-03-02). The `stripeEventId` column has a `UNIQUE` constraint — a duplicate delivery causes a Prisma `P2002` error which is caught and silently acknowledged with HTTP 200 without re-processing. This closes the gap left by the 300-second staleness check, which only filters *very* old replays.

### Realtime Channel Pre-flight Verification

Before subscribing to any Supabase channel, client hooks (`use-presence`, `use-card-lock`) call `GET /api/realtime-auth?boardId=<id>`. That endpoint:
1. Extracts `userId` + `orgId` from the signed Clerk JWT
2. Resolves the internal `User` record (same pattern as `getTenantContext()`)
3. Verifies an active `OrganizationUser` row exists (`isActive = true`, `status = ACTIVE`)
4. Verifies a `BoardMember` row exists for the requested `boardId`
5. Returns `{ allowed: false }` with HTTP 403/401 on any failure — fail-closed

This prevents a user who has been removed from a board from continuing to receive live WebSocket events until their Clerk JWT expires.

### Supabase Realtime Row-Level Security

`supabase-realtime-rls.sql` (run once in Supabase SQL Editor) enables RLS on `realtime.messages` and `realtime.subscription`. Policies restrict channel subscriptions to topics that start with `org:<jwt.org_id>:` — matching the channel naming convention enforced in `lib/realtime-channels.ts`. Requires the Clerk JWT template `supabase` to include `{ "org_id": "{{org.id}}" }`.

### Stripe Replay Attack + TOCTOU

`app/api/webhook/stripe/route.ts` now:
- **Replay guard**: Events older than 300 seconds (`event.created` vs `Date.now()`) are silently rejected with HTTP 200 — Stripe’s default `stripe-signature` tolerance is 300 s, so legitimate retries won’t be affected
- **TOCTOU fix**: The `customer.subscription.deleted` handler uses `db.organization.updateMany()` with a `WHERE stripeSubscriptionId = subscription.id` guard instead of `update()`. This prevents a stale deletion from overwriting a newly-granted PRO status when a delete event arrives out of order

### AI Prompt Injection

`actions/ai-actions.ts` now:
- `sanitizeForPrompt()` strips control characters (`\x00`–`\x1F`), collapses excessive line padding, and trims whitespace before any user content reaches OpenAI
- All three OpenAI calls (`suggestPriority`, `generateCardDescription`, `suggestChecklists`) split input into a **`system`** role message (fixed instructions) and a **`user`** role message (sanitized user-supplied content only). The model gives higher authority to `system` messages, preventing instruction injection via card titles or descriptions

## Performance Optimizations

| Optimization | Implementation |
|---|---|
| **Turbopack** | Dev server uses Turbopack for fast HMR |
| **React Compiler** | `babel-plugin-react-compiler` auto-memoizes all client components |
| **Server Components** | Data-heavy pages render on server with zero client JS |
| **Hydration-safe CSS** | All Tailwind classes use explicit bracket values (`gap-[5px]`, `h-[30px]`, `bg-gradient-to-br`) — eliminates class mismatch hydration errors between server and cached client bundles |
| **Image optimization** | AVIF + WebP formats, 1-hour minimum cache TTL |
| **Virtual scrolling** | `components/virtual-scroll.tsx` renders only visible items |
| **Lazy loading** | `components/lazy-load.tsx` uses Intersection Observer |
| **LexoRank** | Card/list reorder updates exactly 1 DB row regardless of list size |
| **React `cache()`** | `getTenantContext()` deduplicated to 1 DB call per request |
| **Optimistic updates** | Card mutations apply to UI before server responds |
| **Bundle analysis** | `npm run analyze` via `@next/bundle-analyzer` |
| **Tree-shaking** | `optimizePackageImports` for lucide-react, framer-motion, TipTap, Radix, @dnd-kit, Recharts |
| **Static caching** | `/_next/static/*` cached 1 year (immutable) |
| **API no-cache** | `/api/*` routes set `Cache-Control: no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate` |
| **Parallel compilation** | Enabled in `next.config.ts` |
| **PgBouncer** | Connection pooling via port 6543 for all app queries |

### Stage-by-Stage Breakdown

#### Stage 1 — Local Development

The developer works on a feature branch. The recommended local workflow is:

```bash
# 1. Start dev server with Turbopack hot-reload
npm run dev

# 2. Run type-check in watch mode (separate terminal)
npx tsc --noEmit --watch

# 3. Lint on demand
npm run lint

# 4. Run unit tests
npm run test:unit

# 5. Run integration tests (requires running dev server)
npm run test:integration
```

Key safety nets active locally:
- **TypeScript strict mode** — catches type mismatches before the push
- **ESLint** with custom rules — enforces project conventions
- **Zod schemas** — validates action inputs at the boundary
- **React Compiler** — prevents stale closure bugs without manual memoisation

---

#### Stage 2 — Preview Build (every `git push`)

Vercel automatically detects every push on any branch and runs a full preview build:

| Step | Command | What it validates |
|------|---------|-------------------|
| Dependency install | `npm ci` | Lockfile integrity, no phantom packages |
| TypeScript check | `tsc --noEmit` | Zero type errors in strict mode |
| Lint check | `eslint .` | Code style, no banned patterns |
| Build | `next build` | All 39 pages compile and pre-render |
| Edge bundle | automatic | Middleware fits within Vercel Edge 1 MB limit |

**Output:** A unique preview URL (e.g. `nexus-pr-42-xyz.vercel.app`) is posted as a PR comment. The full production-config environment (real Clerk, real Stripe test-mode, real Supabase) is active on the preview, so reviewers test against live services.

---

#### Stage 3 — Code Review & QA

Before merging to `main`, the PR requires:

- At minimum one approving review
- All Vercel preview build checks green
- Manual smoke-test on the preview URL covering: sign-in, board create/drag-drop, real-time sync across two browser tabs, billing portal

---

#### Stage 4 — Production Build (merge to `main`)

Merging to `main` triggers an identical build pipeline, but targeting production infrastructure:

```
main branch push
  → npm ci
  → tsc --noEmit
  → eslint .
  → next build (Turbopack)
  → Static pre-rendering (39 pages)
  → Edge function bundle
  → Zero-downtime deploy via Vercel's blue/green routing
```

**Zero-downtime strategy:** Vercel keeps the previous build live and only cuts traffic over once the new build passes all health checks. A failed build never affects the live site.

---

#### Stage 5 — Database Migration (manual gate)

Prisma migrations are intentionally **not** run automatically during deploy. This is a deliberate safety gate — schema changes are applied manually just before a deploy:

```bash
# Run from your local machine or CI with direct DB access
npx prisma migrate deploy
```

Rationale: automatic migration on deploy can cause irreversible data loss if the migration contains a destructive change and the new code is rolled back. The manual step forces explicit sign-off.

---

#### Stage 6 — Post-Deploy Services

Once production is live, four background services activate immediately:

| Service | Trigger | Purpose |
|---------|---------|---------|
| **Sentry** | First request | Captures exceptions, performance traces, and Web Vitals |
| **Vercel Cron** | `0 9 * * *` (09:00 UTC daily) | Runs `/api/cron/daily-reports` — generates digest emails for active orgs |
| **Supabase Realtime** | Client connects | `postgres_changes` broadcasts to board subscribers (drag-drop, card updates, presence) |
| **Stripe Webhooks** | Payment events | `/api/webhook/stripe` — processes subscription changes, updates org plan in Prisma |

---

### Testing Pipeline

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A["npm run test:ci"] --> B["Jest: Unit Tests\n__tests__/unit/**"]
    A --> C["Jest: Integration Tests\n__tests__/integration/**"]
    B --> D["Coverage report\ncoverage/lcov-report/"]
    C --> D
    D --> E["Playwright: E2E\ne2e/*.spec.ts\n(requires running dev server)"]
    E --> F["All green → PR ready to merge"]
```

Test priorities (in order of importance):
1. **Security & auth** — `tenant-context`, RBAC matrix, rate limiting, API key auth
2. **Billing** — Stripe webhook handlers, checkout session creation, plan sync
3. **Core algorithms** — LexoRank insert/midpoint/rebalance
4. **Critical actions** — card CRUD, drag ordering, board member mutations
5. **Zod schemas** — valid and invalid inputs for every action schema

Coverage targets are secondary to test quality — a brittle high-coverage suite is worse than a robust low-coverage one.

---

### Branch Strategy

```
main          ← production; never commit directly
  └─ feature/* ← all new work; opens PR → triggers preview build
  └─ fix/*     ← hotfixes; same pipeline as feature branches
  └─ chore/*   ← dependency updates, config — still go through PR review
```

Direct pushes to `main` are blocked. Every change to production goes through a reviewed PR with a passing Vercel build.

---

### Environment Variables per Stage

| Variable group | Local (`.env.local`) | Preview (Vercel) | Production (Vercel) |
|---------------|----------------------|------------------|---------------------|
| `DATABASE_URL` | Local Supabase / Docker | Preview Supabase project | Production Supabase project |
| `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` | Dev Clerk app | Dev Clerk app | Production Clerk app |
| `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` | Test mode key | Test mode key | Live mode key |
| `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | `stripe listen` CLI | Preview webhook | Production webhook |
| `CRON_SECRET` | Any random string | Set in Vercel | Set in Vercel |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` | `http://localhost:3000` | Preview URL | `https://yourdomain.com` |

> Never commit `.env.local` — it is gitignored. All production secrets live in Vercel's encrypted environment variable store.

## Workflow Diagrams

> These diagrams show the step-by-step paths that data and users follow through the application. Each one is explained in plain English below the diagram.

---

### 1. User Onboarding Flow

**What this diagram shows:** The path a brand new user takes from first visiting the site to seeing their first board.

**Step by step:**
- User opens the Nexus URL for the first time
- If they don't have an account, they click **Sign Up** — Clerk handles the registration form, email verification, and session creation
- If they already have an account, they click **Sign In** — Clerk validates credentials and issues a signed JWT
- After sign-in, the app calls `getTenantContext()` — this function reads the Clerk JWT, finds the user's internal database record, and creates it automatically if this is their very first sign-in (the "healing" path)
- If the user has no organization yet, they are shown a prompt to create one or request to join an existing one
- Once inside an organization, if no boards exist, they see a prompt to create the first board (or pick from a template)
- After board creation, they land on the full Kanban view

    J -->|Yes| L["Show board list on Dashboard"]
    K --> L
    L --> M["Click a board → Full Kanban view"]
```

### 2. Card Lifecycle

**What this diagram shows:** The full journey of a work item (card) from creation to completion.

**Step by step:**
- A card is created inside a list (column) — either by clicking "Add card" or via AI suggestions
- A team member is assigned to own the work
- Labels (e.g. "Bug", "Feature") and a priority level (Low / Medium / High / Urgent) are set
- Time tracking begins — members log hours spent on the card
- As work progresses, the card is dragged between lists (e.g. from "In Progress" to "Review")
- Throughout the entire lifecycle, teammates can add comments, upload files, tick off checklist items, and link dependencies to other cards
- When work is done, the card is moved to the final "Done" list
- Completed cards can be archived — they disappear from normal view but remain in the database for reporting

    Move --> Review["Move to Review / QA List"]
    Review --> Done["Move to Done List"]
    Done --> Archive["Archive Card"]

        Deps["Link Dependencies (Blocks / Blocked By)"]
        AI["Generate AI Description or Checklist Items"]
        Reactions["React to Comments with Emoji"]
    end
```

---

### 3. Drag & Drop Card Reordering Flow

**What this diagram shows:** Exactly what happens in the system when a user picks up a card and drops it somewhere else — including how the UI stays fast and how other users see the update.

**Step by step:**
- User grabs a card — `@dnd-kit` starts tracking the drag; a ghost copy (`DragOverlay`) follows the cursor
- The UI updates **immediately** (optimistic update) — the card appears in its new position before any server call is made. This makes the app feel instant.
- When the user drops the card, `LexoRank` calculates the new `order` string based on the cards above and below the drop position
- A server action (`update-card-order`) fires — it validates the input, checks the user has permission to move cards on this board, then writes exactly **one row** to the database (just the moved card's `order` field)
- The event bus fires — it checks if any automation rules match (e.g. "when a card is moved to Done, assign the owner") and sends outbound webhooks
- Supabase detects the database change via `postgres_changes` and broadcasts it over the WebSocket channel for this board
- Every other user who has this board open receives the event and their UI updates in real time — they see the card move without refreshing
- If the server action fails, the optimistic update is rolled back and the card snaps back to its original position

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User (Browser)
    participant DND as @dnd-kit
    participant OptUI as Optimistic UI
    participant SA as Server Action
    participant DB as PostgreSQL
    participant EB as Event Bus
    participant RT as Supabase Realtime
    participant Other as Other Users

    U->>DND: Starts dragging card
    DND->>OptUI: Show DragOverlay ghost
    U->>DND: Drops card in new position
    DND->>OptUI: Update local state immediately (0ms delay)
    DND->>SA: Call update-card-order(cardId, newOrder)
    SA->>SA: Validate input via Zod schema
    SA->>SA: getTenantContext() — check auth + MOVE_CARD permission
    SA->>DB: UPDATE card SET order = newLexoRank WHERE id = cardId
    DB-->>SA: Success
    SA->>EB: emitCardEvent(CARD_MOVED)
    par
        EB->>EB: runAutomations()
        EB->>EB: fireWebhooks() (HMAC-signed)
    end
    DB->>RT: postgres_changes fires on card row update
    RT->>Other: Broadcast card move event
    Other->>Other: UI updates — card appears in new position
    Note over U,OptUI: If SA fails → OptUI rolls back to original position
```

---

### 4. Server Action Execution Flow

**What this diagram shows:** The exact lifecycle every server action follows — from the user clicking a button to the database being updated and other users being notified. This is the same pattern used by all 40 server actions in the codebase.

**Step by step:**
- User does something in the UI (e.g. creates a card, adds a label, invites a member)
- The browser calls a Next.js Server Action directly — no `fetch()` to a REST endpoint needed
- `createSafeAction` (the shared wrapper) first validates the input using a Zod schema — if validation fails, field errors are returned immediately with no DB involvement
- `getTenantContext()` runs — it reads the Clerk JWT to get `userId` and `orgId`, then verifies the user is an active organization member. If this fails, a 403 error is returned.
- The RBAC permission check runs — the specific permission needed for this action is checked against the user's board role and any custom permission scheme
- Prisma runs the database mutation, scoped to `orgId` — it is impossible for a bug to accidentally write to another tenant's data because every query includes the `orgId` filter
- `emitCardEvent()` fires asynchronously — automations and outbound webhooks run in parallel without slowing down the response
- `createAuditLog()` writes an immutable record of what happened
- The result is returned to the browser — on success the UI confirms; on failure the error is user-safe (internal IDs and stack traces are never sent to the client)

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client as Browser
    participant SA as Server Action
    participant CSA as createSafeAction wrapper
    participant ZOD as Zod Schema
    participant TC as getTenantContext
    participant RBAC as Permission Check
    participant DB as PostgreSQL (Prisma)
    participant EB as Event Bus
    participant AL as Audit Log
    participant RT as Supabase Realtime

    Client->>SA: User triggers action (e.g. createCard)
    SA->>CSA: Pass raw input
    CSA->>ZOD: Validate input shape and types
    alt Validation fails
        ZOD-->>Client: Return fieldErrors immediately
    end
    ZOD-->>CSA: Input is valid
    CSA->>TC: getTenantContext()
    TC-->>CSA: { userId, orgId, role } OR TenantError
    alt Not authenticated or suspended
        TC-->>Client: 403 Forbidden
    end
    CSA->>RBAC: Check permission (e.g. CREATE_CARD)
    alt Permission denied
        RBAC-->>Client: 403 Forbidden
    end
    RBAC-->>CSA: Allowed
    CSA->>DB: Execute mutation scoped to orgId
    DB-->>CSA: Saved record
    CSA->>AL: createAuditLog(action, before, after)
    CSA->>EB: emitCardEvent()
    par Runs in parallel, does not block response
        EB->>EB: runAutomations()
        EB->>EB: fireWebhooks() with HMAC-SHA256 signature
    end
    CSA-->>Client: { data: result }
    DB->>RT: postgres_changes broadcast to all board subscribers
```

---

### 5. Authentication & Tenant Isolation Flow

**What this diagram shows:** How every single request is authenticated and isolated to the correct tenant — ensuring one organization can never accidentally access another's data.

**Step by step:**
- Every request (whether a page load, server action, or API call) starts by calling `auth()` from Clerk — this reads the signed session cookie
- Clerk returns the `userId` and `orgId` extracted from the JWT — these are cryptographically signed and cannot be faked or tampered with by the client
- `getTenantContext()` takes those values and queries the database:
  - Looks up the internal `User` record by `clerkUserId` — creates it if not found (first sign-in)
  - Looks up the `OrganizationUser` membership record — creates it if not found (first time joining an org)
  - If the membership exists but `isActive = false` or `status = SUSPENDED`, the request is rejected
- The `orgId` from the JWT is set as a PostgreSQL session variable — Row-Level Security policies at the database level then automatically filter every query to only return rows belonging to that org
- All subsequent Prisma queries are scoped by `orgId` both in the application WHERE clauses AND at the database engine level (double protection)

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Browser
    participant NextJS as Next.js Server
    participant Clerk as Clerk Auth
    participant App as getTenantContext()
    participant PG as PostgreSQL + RLS

    Browser->>NextJS: Any request (page / action / API)
    NextJS->>Clerk: auth() — read signed session cookie
    Clerk-->>NextJS: { userId, orgId } from JWT claims
    Note over NextJS: orgId is NEVER read from query params or request body
    NextJS->>App: getTenantContext(userId, orgId)
    App->>PG: SELECT User WHERE clerkUserId = userId
    alt User not found (first sign-in)
        App->>PG: INSERT User (healing path)
    end
    App->>PG: SELECT OrganizationUser WHERE userId + orgId
    alt Membership not found
        App->>PG: INSERT OrganizationUser (auto-join)
    end
    alt isActive = false OR status = SUSPENDED
        App-->>Browser: 403 Forbidden
    end
    App->>PG: SET app.current_org_id = orgId (RLS session variable)
    Note over PG: All subsequent queries filtered by RLS policies at DB engine level
    App-->>NextJS: TenantContext { userId, orgId, role }
    NextJS->>PG: Execute business logic query (scoped by orgId in WHERE + RLS)
    PG-->>NextJS: Data for this org only
    NextJS-->>Browser: Response
```

## Use Case Diagram

> This section describes **who can do what** in Nexus. There are two separate layers of access control — Organization level and Board level. A user must pass both gates to interact with a board.

### How the Two-Gate System Works

- **Gate 1 — Organization Membership:** The user must be an active member of the organization. Their role at this level is `OWNER`, `ADMIN`, `MEMBER`, or `GUEST`.
- **Gate 2 — Board Membership:** Even if the user is an org OWNER, they still need an explicit `BoardMember` record to access a specific board. Without it, the board is completely invisible to them.
- **Role inheritance:** Being an org OWNER does not automatically make you a board OWNER — the two roles are independent.

---

### Role Permissions — Plain English

#### Guest (accessed via public share link — no account needed)
- Can view the board they were given a link to
- Can view all cards on that board
- Can optionally leave comments if the share link allows it
- Cannot create, edit, move, or delete any cards
- Cannot see any other boards in the organization
- Cannot see member information beyond public names
- Their session is time-limited and can be password-protected by the board owner

#### Board Viewer (has an account, added to the board as Viewer role)
- Everything a Guest can do, plus:
- Can see card details including attachments, checklists, time logs, and comments
- Can see who is online on the board via presence avatars
- Cannot create, edit, move, or delete any cards
- Cannot add comments
- Can export visible data to PDF if analytics are enabled

#### Board Member (the standard working role for contributors)
- Everything a Viewer can do, plus:
- Can create new cards in any list
- Can edit card titles, descriptions, due dates, labels, and priorities
- Can drag and drop cards between lists and reorder them
- Can add rich-text comments and react to other comments with emoji
- Can upload files and attachments to cards (up to 100 MB per file)
- Can log time spent working on a card
- Can tick off checklist items
- Can link card dependencies (marks one card as blocking another)
- Can assign themselves or others to cards (if they have org membership)
- Can use AI to generate descriptions and checklist items
- Cannot delete cards (deletion requires Admin or above)
- Cannot change board settings or manage who has access

#### Board Admin (trusted team lead role)
- Everything a Member can do, plus:
- Can delete any card on the board
- Can edit board settings (title, background image, description)
- Can invite members to the board and remove them
- Can change any members board role (Member ↔ Viewer)
- Can configure custom permission schemes for the board or individual members
- Can create a public share link with optional password and expiry date
- Can archive or unarchive any card
- Can create, start, and complete sprints
- Cannot delete the board itself
- Cannot manage organization-level settings

#### Org Owner (highest privilege — typically the account creator or designated admin)
- Everything a Board Admin can do on any board, plus:
- Can create new boards (and set them as public or private)
- Can delete boards permanently
- Can manage all organization members — invite, remove, change org roles, suspend members
- Can manage Stripe billing — upgrade to PRO, view invoices, cancel subscription
- Can view organization-wide analytics across all boards
- Can export any data to CSV, JSON, or PDF
- Can configure automation rules ("when X happens, do Y")
- Can manage outbound webhooks (register endpoints, view delivery logs)
- Can create and revoke API keys for the public REST API
- Can configure third-party integrations (GitHub, Slack)
- Can access GDPR tools — export user data, process deletion requests
- Can view the full audit log across all boards and all members

## Scalability

### Current Design

- **Stateless API** — All state lives in PostgreSQL. Any Vercel serverless function can handle any request
- **PgBouncer** — Pools DB connections on port 6543. Prisma connects through the pooler; direct connection on port 5432 for migrations only
- **O(1) ordering** — LexoRank insertions touch exactly one DB row regardless of list size
- **Request deduplication** — `getTenantContext()` wrapped in `cache()` — one auth + DB call per request maximum
- **Edge network** — Vercel global edge for all static assets cached with 1-year immutable headers
- **Event fan-out** — `emitCardEvent()` uses `Promise.allSettled()` — automations and webhooks run in parallel without blocking the HTTP response

### Scaling Considerations

| Concern | Current | Production Scale Path |
|---|---|---|
| Rate limiting | Upstash Redis (distributed) with in-memory fallback — `lib/rate-limit.ts` | Add `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL` + `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN` env vars to enable distributed mode |
| DB connections | Supabase free tier limits | Scale Supabase plan, monitor PgBouncer utilization |
| Realtime connections | Per-project Supabase limits | Shard by organization at high concurrency |
| File storage | Supabase Storage | Add CDN in front of storage bucket |
| Automation engine | Max depth 3, synchronous | Move to background job queue (e.g., BullMQ + Redis) |
| AI quota | Per-org daily counter | Already implemented — extend with per-user limits |

---

## Known Limitations & Roadmap

### Current Limitations

- **Rate limiting** — Distributed Upstash Redis when env vars are set; falls back to single-instance in-memory Map when running without Upstash credentials (e.g. local dev or deployments that haven't configured Upstash yet)
- **Test coverage is ~19.5%** — Core paths (auth, billing, RBAC) are covered; UI components are not
- **No offline support** — Service Worker handles push notifications only, not offline caching
- **No native mobile app** — Web UI is responsive, but no iOS/Android app exists
- **No SSO/SAML** — Enterprise authentication not yet implemented
- **Supabase Realtime RLS** — requires manual one-time SQL execution in Supabase Dashboard (`supabase-realtime-rls.sql`) and Clerk JWT template configuration

### Potential Roadmap Items

- Redis-backed distributed rate limiting (Upstash)
- Offline-first support with background sync
- Native mobile application (React Native or enhanced PWA)
- SSO/SAML for enterprise authentication
- Google Calendar and Outlook integration
- AI-powered task prioritization and workload balancing
- Board activity heatmaps
- Advanced historical analytics with trend predictions

## Changelog

### Latest Updates

| Date | Commit | Change |
|---|---|---|
| 2026-03-02 | `2550b71` | Security: `lib/rate-limit.ts` rewritten async — Upstash Redis sliding-window when `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL` + `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN` are set; in-memory fallback on Redis error (fail-open) |
| 2026-03-02 | `2550b71` | Security: Stripe idempotency — `ProcessedStripeEvent` model + Prisma `P2002` guard before webhook `switch`; duplicate Stripe events silently ack'd without re-processing |
| 2026-03-02 | `2550b71` | Security: `app/api/realtime-auth` — new GET endpoint verifying org membership + `BoardMember` row before any Supabase channel subscription; fail-closed on DB error |
| 2026-03-02 | `2550b71` | Security: `hooks/use-presence.ts` + `hooks/use-card-lock.ts` — pre-flight call to `/api/realtime-auth` before subscribing to any Supabase channel; authenticated Supabase client; org-scoped channel names |
| 2026-03-02 | `2550b71` | Security: `supabase-realtime-rls.sql` — RLS policies for `realtime.messages` + `realtime.subscription` scoped to JWT `org_id` claim |
| 2026-03-02 | `503c1c8` | Security: RBAC desync fixed — `lib/tenant-context.ts` healing path wrapped in `db.$transaction()`, uses real DB `isActive`/`status`, immediately throws `FORBIDDEN` for suspended rows |
| 2026-03-02 | `503c1c8` | Security: Realtime auth — `hooks/use-realtime-analytics.ts` now uses `getAuthenticatedSupabaseClient(token)` with Clerk JWT (was unauthenticated) |
| 2026-03-02 | `503c1c8` | Security: LexoRank DoS guard — `update-card-order.ts` + `update-list-order.ts` reject order strings > 64 chars |
| 2026-03-02 | `503c1c8` | Security: Stripe replay guard (300 s staleness check) + TOCTOU fix (`updateMany` with subscription ID guard) in webhook handler |
| 2026-03-02 | `503c1c8` | Security: AI prompt injection protection — `sanitizeForPrompt()` strips control chars; all 3 OpenAI calls now use `system`/`user` role separation |
| 2026-02 | `9c8591c` | Security: `lib/rate-limit.ts` — new in-memory sliding-window rate limiter; applied to `/api/ai` at 20 req/user/min with 429 + `Retry-After` |
| 2026-02 | `9c8591c` | Security: HSTS + `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy` + `Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy` + `X-Permitted-Cross-Domain-Policies` added to `next.config.ts` |
| 2026-02 | `9c8591c` | Security: Vercel function `maxDuration` explicit timeouts added to `vercel.json` (upload=60 s, ai=30 s, cron=300 s) |
| 2026-02 | `9c8591c` | Fix: Mass `bg-linear-to-*` → `bg-gradient-to-*` correction across 20+ files (invalid Tailwind v4 class that silently produced no gradients) |
| 2026-02-24 | `ecf5122` | Fix: Mobile view — `sidebar.tsx` + `mobile-nav.tsx` Clerk components (`OrganizationSwitcher`, `UserButton`) loaded via `dynamic({ ssr: false })` with skeleton placeholders; eliminates hydration mismatch and CLS |
| 2026-02-24 | `ecf5122` | Fix: `AriaLiveRegion` hydration mismatch — `mounted` guard added; component returns `null` until after first client render |
| 2026-02-24 | — | Fix: Unsplash `/api/unsplash` 500 → 200 — null-check guard returns `{ photos: [], unconfigured: true }` when key missing; unified `UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY` key handling; removed dangerous `NEXT_PUBLIC_` server fallback |
| 2026-02-24 | — | Fix: Board creation flow — `fieldErrors.title` branch added to handler; templates seeded with 8 professional templates |
| 2025-07 | — | Fixed file upload route (`POST /api/upload`) — proper try/catch error handling, `sb_secret_*` key format support |
| 2025-07 | — | Eliminated React hydration mismatch in `board-header.tsx` — replaced all Tailwind v4-only shorthands with bracket equivalents |
| 2025-07 | — | Card modal delete flow wired end-to-end — `handleDeleteCard` connected to both dropdown and sidebar delete buttons |
| 2025-07 | — | Removed render-blocking `@import url(fonts.googleapis.com/...)` from card modal — fonts load globally via `next/font` |
| 2025-07 | — | Fixed board tab icon visibility — added `group` + `group-data-[state=active]:opacity-100` pattern for active state |
